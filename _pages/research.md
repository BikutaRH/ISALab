ASR Systems try to map each signal input to the corresponding text. The architecture of ASR Systems typically includes Feature Extractor, Acoustic Model (Encoder) and Decoder. In many situations, Language Model might be used to improve prediction accuracy. After being extracted by Feature Extractor, data are encoded by the Encoder and decoded by the Decoder to produce the text.
